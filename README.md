# TDI-CapstoneProject:  Predicting Heat Treatment from Micrographs

Welcome to my TDI capstone project where I build a TensorFlow model that can recover the heat treatment of steel from micrographs.

What is a micrograph? It is a picture of the microstructure of the steel, the microscopic architecture. This microstructure is formed via the heat treatment of the steel and determines its physcial proeprties.
